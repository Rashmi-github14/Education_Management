This is my PowerBi Dashboard which I create in the challenge 13 of Fp20 analysics.
The project is about making a data-driven dashboard to see the challenges driven from the student per school year which is split into 3 semesters (Fall, Winter and Spring). 
Each student is assessed each semester using three test (assessment) types - TOSREC, TOWRE and TOSWRF - using standard score system. 
For each test there is a known associated cost per student and get the insight out of it.
